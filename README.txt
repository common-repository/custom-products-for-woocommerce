<h4>Custom Products for WooCommerce</h4>
<p><em>Offer your visitors a unique shopping experience.<br />
</em></p>
<p>This plugin gives you the ability to setup a store where your visitors can customize their products before buying them.</p>
<p>Custom Products for WooCommerce is an extension for WooCommerce that adds a new level to the product-attribute hirearchy. Instead of assigning attributes to products, split products into multiple components and assign attributes to components.</p>
<p>It was made to be as universal as possible so you can customize pretty much every type of product. See the <a href="https://woocp-demo.grrega.com/">demo</a> to get an idea of what this plugin is capable of.</p>

<h4>Shortcode</h4>
<code>[woocp product_ids="1,2,3" number_of_products="3" width="100%" order="ASC" orderby="title" class="classname" hide_msg_area="true" hide_select="true"]</code>
<p>You can use the shortcode to get product customizer anywhere on your site.
Shortcode accepts the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>product_ids - a comma separated list of product IDs</li>
<li>category_ids - a comma separated list of category IDs</li>
<li>number_of_products - limit of produts to show</li>
<li>width - product customizer width (px, em, %, ...)</li>
<li>image_width - customizer image width (%)</li>
<li>list_width - components list width (%)</li>
<li>class - classname(s) for CSS/JS purposes</li>
<li>order - order products (ASC, DESC)</li>
<li>orderby - order products by (none, ID, title, name, date, modified, rand)</li>
<li>hide_msg_area - hide/show WooCommerce loader and message section under the add to cart button (default: false)</li>
<li>hide_select - hide/show product select dropdown (default: false)</li>
</ul>

== FAQ ==

= How to override template files =

Template files are stored at the "/custom-products-for-woocommerce/templates" folder.

1. Create a subfolder "/custom-products-for-woocommerce" in your child themes folder.
2. Copy the template that you want to override from the plugins "/templates" folder to the new folder in your child theme
3. Edit the template

= Why do I get redirected to the homepage after clicking the "Customize" button on product page? =

You need to set "Customizer URL" field in the <strong>Customizer settings</strong> section of the <strong>Custom Products tab</strong> on the <strong>WooCommerce settings</strong> page.
Enter an URL of a page that has the <strong>[woocp]</strong> shortcode somewhere in the content.
If you do not set the "Customizer URL" field the plugin will assume your <strong>[woocp]</strong> shortcode is on your homepage.

  - show default variation in [woocp] shortcode if product ID (instead of variation ID) of a variable product is passed (from the "customize" button). You can override this behaviour by inserting custom [woocp_customize_button id="VARIATION_ID"] shorcodes for each variation.
